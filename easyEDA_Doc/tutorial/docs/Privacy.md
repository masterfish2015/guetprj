# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At EasyEDA we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.
We don’t share your data with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.


We utilize SSL throughout the entire domain EasyEDA.com. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology encrypts all data transferred between your computer and our servers. Your data is for your eyes only.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact our support@easyeda.com.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, EasyEDA collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. EasyEDA’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how EasyEDA’s visitors use its website. From time to time, EasyEDA may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

##Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to EasyEDA’s websites choose to interact with EasyEDA in ways that require EasyEDA to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that EasyEDA gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to EasyEDA to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with EasyEDA – by purchasing PCB, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal   information required to process those transactions and shipping. In each case, EasyEDA collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with EasyEDA. EasyEDA does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
 
## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

EasyEDA discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on EasyEDA’s behalf or to provide services available at EasyEDA’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using EasyEDA’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. EasyEDA will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, EasyEDA discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when EasyEDA believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of EasyEDA, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an EasyEDA website and have supplied your email address, EasyEDA may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with EasyEDA and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. EasyEDA takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
